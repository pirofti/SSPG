# Stochastic proximal splitting algorithm for composite minimization

Implementation of the [SSPG algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02039) for composite minimzation described in
A. Pătrașcu and P. Irofti, "Stochastic proximal splitting algorithm for composite minimization," in arXiv:1912.02039, 2020.

Have a look at the [test script](test_gensr_errs.py) for a full example.
